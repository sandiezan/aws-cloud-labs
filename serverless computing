Lab title:
Working with AWS Lambda

Description:
In this lab, you deploy and configure an AWS Lambda based serverless computing solution. 
The Lambda function generates a sales analysis report by pulling data from a database and emailing the results daily.

Achieved results:
Recognised necessary AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy permissions to facilitate a Lambda function to other Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources.
Created a Lambda layer to satisfy an external library dependency.
Created Lambda functions that extract data from database, and send reports to user.
Deployed and test a Lambda function that is initiated based on a schedule and that invokes another function.
Used CloudWatch logs to troubleshoot any issues running a Lambda function.
